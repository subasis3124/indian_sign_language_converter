## Introduction
The Indian Sign Language (ISL) Converter app is a Flutter-based application designed to facilitate communication between users and the deaf or hard of hearing community. The app's UI/UX focuses on simplicity and accessibility, featuring a clean, intuitive interface with a pink-themed color palette. The main screen offers a grid layout with rounded icons, representing various functionalities such as Sign Language to Text/Speech, Text to Sign, and Voice to Sign. Each icon is labeled, making navigation straightforward.

The app includes full-screen modes for features like A-Z Sign Alphabets, and a scorable quiz section. Users can also access video lectures and educational content. Support and Contact Us sections are available at the bottom, providing users with help and feedback options. The app's design ensures a seamless and engaging experience for users of all ages.
